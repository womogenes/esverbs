# Spanish Verb Conjugator

Hello! This readme has information about the code and license.

## Code

I used a library called jsESverb. You can find it here: https://github.com/cubiwan/jsESverb

If you would like to improve the site, feel free to submit a pull request! If you find incorrect conjugations, please submit a PR to the [jsESverb](https://github.com/cubiwan/jsESverb) repo instead.



## License

The jsESverb is licensed under the [GPL v3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), so this app has to be GPL-licensed too. I would rather use a less strict license, so I might switch libraries in the future.
